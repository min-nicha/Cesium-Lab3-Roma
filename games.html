                 <p>The game is a beat 'em up with elements of an action role-playing game. The player controls one character as he engages multiple enemies until reaching the boss of the stage. The character possesses normal techniques and special moves as well as Desperation Moves. The last two cannot be used consecutively as the player is given time to prepare for the next usage of the move. </p>
